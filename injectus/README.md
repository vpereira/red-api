## Example of process injection in go

## How to build it

Download the dependencies:

```GO111MODULE=on go get mvdan.cc/garble```

and `make tidy && make build-release`

Check the Makefile for other build options

Note that we are using garble to obfuscate the code. 

Code tested on WIN7 and WIN10
